# 🖥️ System Overlay Python Script

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is a **Python script** designed to create a system overlay on the user's screen. It utilizes the `tkinter` library to render a transparent, always-on-top window that can display custom messages or graphics, serving as a lightweight heads-up display (HUD) or notification system.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- ** Overlay Window** 🪟  
  Creates a borderless, window that overlays all other windows on the screen.

- **Customizable Display** 🎨  
  Allows for customization of the overlay content, including text messages and graphical elements.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** 🌐  
  Built using standard Python libraries to ensure compatibility across different operating systems.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Window Creation**: Initializes a `tkinter` window with no borders and sets it to be always on top.

2. **Transparency Settings**: Configures the window to have a transparent background, allowing underlying applications to remain visible.

3. **Content Rendering**: Displays information on the overlay, which is updated dynamically.
